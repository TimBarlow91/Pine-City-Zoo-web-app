                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The Giant Panda, scientifically known as <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>, is a bear species native to
                    the mountainous
                    regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. It is one of the
                    most well-known
                    and beloved animals in the world, recognized for its striking black-and-white fur pattern and gentle
                    demeanor.</p>

                <p>Pandas are medium-sized bears, weighing between 70 to 160 kilograms, with males generally being
                    larger than females.
                    They have a distinctive appearance, with black fur around their eyes, ears, shoulders, and legs, and
                    white fur on
                    the rest of their bodies. Their thick fur helps keep them warm in their cool mountain habitat.</p>

                <p>Although pandas belong to the order Carnivora, they are primarily herbivorous and feed almost
                    exclusively on bamboo.
                    They consume 12 to 38 kilograms of bamboo daily to meet their energy needs, using their strong jaws
                    and an extended
                    wrist bone that functions like a thumb to grasp and strip bamboo stalks. Occasionally, pandas may
                    eat small mammals,
                    birds, or carrion, but this is rare.</p>

                <p>Giant pandas are generally solitary animals, with each adult having its own territory. They
                    communicate with each
                    other through scent markings, vocalizations, and body language. Pandas are most active during the
                    morning and
                    evening and spend the majority of their day foraging and eating.</p>

                <p>Breeding season occurs once a year, between March and May. After a gestation period of about 95 to
                    160 days, a female
                    usually gives birth to one or two cubs, although only one typically survives in the wild. Panda cubs
                    are born tiny,
                    blind, and helpless, and they stay with their mothers for up to 18 months before becoming
                    independent.</p>

                <p>In the wild, pandas face threats such as habitat loss, climate change, and low reproductive rates.
                    Conservation
                    efforts in China, including the establishment of panda reserves and captive breeding programs, have
                    helped increase
                    their population. Thanks to these efforts, the giant panda's status was changed from "Endangered" to
                    "Vulnerable" by
                    the IUCN in 2016.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about pandas include that they can climb trees and swim well, despite their clumsy
                    appearance. They
                    also have the digestive system of a carnivore, but their diet is almost entirely bamboo. Pandas have
                    become global
                    symbols of wildlife conservation and are the official logo of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
