                <h3>GIRAFFE (GIRAFFA CAMELOPARDALIS)</h3>

                <p>The Giraffe is the tallest land animal on Earth and one of the most iconic animals of Africa.
                    Scientifically known as
                    <em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>, giraffes are known for their extremely long necks, long legs, and
                    distinctive
                    spotted coats. They are native to various parts of sub-Saharan Africa, typically inhabiting
                    savannas, grasslands,
                    and open woodlands.
                </p>

                <p>Adult male giraffes (called bulls) can reach heights of up to 5.5 to 6 meters (18 to 20 feet) and
                    weigh between 1,200
                    to 1,900 kilograms. Females (cows) are generally slightly shorter and lighter. Their necks alone can
                    be over 2
                    meters long, containing the same number of vertebrae (seven) as most mammals, though much longer in
                    size.</p>

                <p>Giraffes are herbivores, feeding mainly on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of tall trees—especially
                    acacias. Their
                    long tongues (up to 45 cm) and prehensile lips help them grasp and strip leaves from branches.
                    Giraffes often spend
                    most of the day browsing for food and can consume up to 34 kilograms of foliage daily.</p>

                <p>Despite their size, giraffes are quite agile and can run at speeds up to 60 km/h over short
                    distances. They are
                    social animals, often found in loose herds, although they do not form strong social bonds like some
                    other animals.
                    Giraffes communicate through various vocalizations, body language, and even infrasound below the
                    human hearing
                    range.</p>

                <p>Reproduction in giraffes involves a gestation period of about 15 months, after which a single calf is
                    born. Newborns
                    are already around 1.8 meters tall at birth and can stand and walk within hours. Calves are
                    vulnerable to predators
                    such as lions, hyenas, and leopards, and many do not survive their first year.</p>

                <p>Adult giraffes have few natural predators due to their size and powerful kicks, which can be lethal.
                    However, they
                    still need to be cautious, especially when drinking water, as they must awkwardly spread their legs
                    and lower their
                    necks, making them more vulnerable.</p>

                <p>Giraffes play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping control tree growth and spreading seeds
                    through their
                    droppings. Their population is currently declining in some areas due to habitat loss, poaching, and
                    human-wildlife
                    conflict, and they are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about giraffes include their unique coat patterns—no two individuals have the same
                    pattern—and
                    their ability to sleep for only short periods, often standing up. They also have high blood pressure
                    due to their
                    long necks and specialized cardiovascular systems to manage blood flow to their brains.</p>

                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the Giraffes at pen E28, right next to the Koalas.</p>
