                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>The Warthog, scientifically known as <em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>, is a wild member of the pig
                    family found
                    throughout the grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Warthogs are well
                    adapted to their
                    environment and are known for their resilience, speed, and unique appearance.</p>

                <p>Warthogs have a large, stocky body covered in sparse hair, with a mane running down their back. Their
                    most
                    distinctive features are their large, curved tusks and the wart-like growths on their face, which
                    are actually thick
                    protective pads. Males are larger than females, weighing between 60 to 150 kilograms and standing
                    around 63 to 85
                    centimeters tall at the shoulder.</p>

                <p>They are omnivorous, though their diet primarily consists of grasses, roots, berries, and bark. They
                    are also known
                    to dig for bulbs and tubers with their snouts and tusks. Occasionally, warthogs may eat insects,
                    eggs, or small
                    animals. During dry seasons, they may kneel on their front knees to graze on short grasses.</p>

                <p>Warthogs are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day, especially in the early morning and
                    late afternoon.
                    They live in burrows, often taking over abandoned aardvark holes, which provide shelter from
                    predators and extreme
                    temperatures. When entering the burrow, warthogs typically back in so they can defend themselves
                    with their tusks if
                    threatened.</p>

                <p>They usually live in small family groups called sounders, consisting of females and their offspring.
                    Adult males are
                    more solitary, joining sounders only during the mating season. Warthogs breed once a year, and after
                    a gestation
                    period of about 5 to 6 months, the female gives birth to a litter of 2 to 8 piglets.</p>

                <p>Warthogs have many natural predators, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and crocodiles.
                    Despite their odd
                    appearance, warthogs are fast runners and can reach speeds of up to 48 km/h. When fleeing, they
                    often run with their
                    tails held upright as a visual signal to others.</p>

                <p>Although not considered endangered, warthogs face threats from habitat loss and hunting in some
                    areas. However, they
                    are quite adaptable and are commonly seen in national parks and wildlife reserves across Africa.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about warthogs include their ability to go for long periods without water during
                    dry seasons, their
                    strong social bonds within sounders, and their surprising agility and speed. They are also known for
                    their comical,
                    expressive faces and are famously represented by the character Pumbaa in Disney's “The Lion King.”

                </strong>
                <p>You will find the Warthogs right next to the amphitheatre, just before the Elephants.</p>
