                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth and are closely related to humans, sharing about 98% of
                    our DNA. They
                    belong to the genus <em>Gorilla</em> and are native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    Gorillas are known
                    for their incredible strength, intelligence, and social behavior.</p>

                <p>There are two species of gorillas—**Eastern Gorilla** (<em>Gorilla beringei</em>) and **Western
                    Gorilla**
                    (<em>Gorilla gorilla</em>)—each with two subspecies. They inhabit dense forests, swamps, and lowland
                    jungles,
                    depending on the region and subspecies.</p>

                <p>Adult male gorillas, known as silverbacks due to the distinctive silver hair on their backs, can
                    weigh between 135 to
                    220 kilograms and stand around 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall when upright. Females are smaller, typically
                    weighing 70 to
                    110 kilograms. Gorillas move primarily by knuckle-walking, using their long arms to support their
                    weight.</p>

                <p>Gorillas are herbivores and spend most of their day feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo
                    shoots. Occasionally,
                    they may eat insects. Their diet varies based on habitat and availability of food, and they rarely
                    drink water
                    directly since they get most of their hydration from the plants they eat.</p>

                <p>Gorillas live in family groups called troops, typically led by a dominant silverback male. A troop
                    can include
                    several females, their offspring, and sometimes younger males. The silverback is responsible for
                    leading, making
                    decisions, protecting the group, and resolving conflicts.</p>

                <p>Reproduction in gorillas involves a gestation period of about 8.5 months. A single infant is usually
                    born and is
                    cared for intensively by its mother. Infants cling to their mothers for the first few months and
                    begin walking at
                    around 6 to 9 months. Young gorillas are playful and learn social skills through interaction with
                    siblings and other
                    juveniles.</p>

                <p>Gorillas are generally gentle and shy but can display aggression when threatened. Silverbacks may
                    beat their chests,
                    roar, or charge to defend their group. Despite their intimidating size, gorillas rarely attack
                    unless provoked.</p>

                <p>Sadly, gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat destruction, poaching, disease (like the
                    Ebola virus), and
                    conflict with humans. Conservation efforts are ongoing, including protected reserves, ecotourism,
                    and international
                    laws against wildlife trafficking.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about gorillas include their use of tools in the wild, such as using sticks to
                    measure water depth
                    or gather food. They are highly intelligent and capable of showing emotions like joy, sadness, and
                    empathy. Some
                    gorillas in captivity have even learned elements of sign language to communicate with humans.</p>

                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the Gorillas at pen E32, right next to the Monkey Trail.</p>
