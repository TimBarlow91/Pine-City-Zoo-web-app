                <p>Need a quick caffeine fix or a cozy place to unwind during your zoo visit? Stop by the <strong>Zoo
                        Coffee
                        Shop</strong>, your go-to spot for freshly brewed coffee, teas, and a delicious selection of
                    pastries and light
                    snacks. Located near the entrance, itâ€™s the perfect place to start or end your day at the zoo.</p>

                    views of the nearby
                    gardens. Enjoy specialty drinks like the "Elephant Espresso," "Caramel Monkey Mocha," or a
                    refreshing iced latte on
                    a warm day. We also offer fruit smoothies, hot chocolate, and kid-friendly drink options.</p>

                <p>Pair your drink with a fresh muffin, a flaky croissant, or one of our locally made treats. Vegan and
                    gluten-free
                    options are available, and all packaging is compostable to help keep the zoo green and clean.</p>
