                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are intelligent, social mammals that belong to the primate order, specifically the infraorder
                    <em>Simiiformes</em>. They are divided into two main groups: **New World monkeys**, which live in
                    Central and South
                    America, and **Old World monkeys**, which are native to Africa and Asia. These two groups differ in
                    physical traits,
                    habitats, and behavior.
                </p>

                <p>Monkeys vary greatly in size and appearance. The smallest is the pygmy marmoset, which weighs about
                    100 grams, while
                    the largest is the mandrill, which can weigh over 30 kilograms. Most monkeys have tails (unlike
                    apes) and are highly
                    agile, using their limbs and tails to swing, climb, and leap through trees or move across the
                    ground.</p>

                <p>New World monkeys, such as capuchins and howler monkeys, often have prehensile tails that can grasp
                    and hold onto
                    branches. They tend to live high in the forest canopy and have flatter noses. Old World monkeys,
                    like baboons and
                    macaques, have narrow noses and do not have prehensile tails. Many are adapted to both ground and
                    tree living.</p>

                <p>Monkeys are omnivores, meaning they eat a wide variety of foods. Their diet includes fruits, leaves,
                    flowers, seeds,
                    nuts, insects, eggs, and occasionally small animals. Their feeding habits help disperse seeds and
                    play a role in
                    maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Monkeys are highly social animals and typically live in groups called troops. Group sizes and social
                    structures vary
                    by species, but most have complex hierarchies and strong social bonds. Grooming is a common behavior
                    that helps
                    build and maintain relationships within the group.</p>

                <p>Reproduction in monkeys varies by species, but typically involves a gestation period of 4 to 8
                    months. Mothers are
                    the primary caregivers, and infants cling to them for support and protection. In some species,
                    fathers or other
                    group members also help care for the young.</p>

                <p>Monkeys use a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language to communicate. Some
                    species are
                    capable of problem-solving, using tools, and learning simple tasks. Their intelligence and
                    adaptability have made
                    them subjects of scientific study and, unfortunately, exploitation in some cases.</p>

                <p>Threats to monkeys include habitat loss due to deforestation, hunting for bushmeat, illegal pet
                    trade, and conflict
                    with humans. Many monkey species are endangered or threatened, and conservation efforts are vital to
                    their survival.
                </p>

                <p>Interesting facts about monkeys include that capuchins have been observed using stones as tools, some
                    monkeys use
                    alarm calls to warn others of predators, and Japanese macaques are known to wash their food. Monkeys
                    are among the
                    most curious and playful animals in the animal kingdom.</p>
