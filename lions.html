                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <p>The Lion, scientifically known as <em>Panthera leo</em>, is one of the most iconic big cats in the
                    world and often
                    referred to as the "King of the Jungle" — though it actually inhabits savannas and grasslands rather
                    than jungles.
                    Lions are native to Africa and a small region of India (the Gir Forest), where the Asiatic lion
                    subspecies lives.
                </p>

                <p>Lions are large and muscular cats with short tawny coats. Males are easily distinguished by their
                    majestic manes,
                    which vary in color from blonde to black and serve to intimidate rivals and attract mates. Adult
                    males typically
                    weigh between 150 to 250 kilograms, while females weigh between 110 to 180 kilograms.</p>

                <p>Lions are social animals and live in groups called prides, which consist of related females, their
                    offspring, and a
                    few dominant males. Prides can range from 3 to 30 individuals. The females are usually the hunters,
                    working
                    cooperatively to take down prey, while males protect the pride's territory and offspring.</p>

                <p>They are carnivores and feed on a variety of large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeest, buffalo,
                    and antelope.
                    Lions are apex predators, meaning they sit at the top of the food chain with no natural predators,
                    although they
                    sometimes scavenge or steal kills from other animals like hyenas or leopards.</p>

                <p>Female lions give birth after a gestation period of around 110 days, usually to a litter of 1 to 4
                    cubs. Cubs are
                    born blind and helpless, relying entirely on their mothers. They begin eating meat at around 3
                    months old but
                    continue nursing for up to 6 months or more. Cubs are vulnerable to predators and even infanticide
                    by incoming
                    males.</p>

                <p>Lions are mostly active at night (nocturnal) and during cooler times of the day. They may rest or
                    sleep for up to 20
                    hours a day, conserving energy for hunting. Roaring is an important form of communication, used to
                    mark territory
                    and coordinate within the pride — a lion's roar can be heard up to 8 kilometers away.</p>

                <p>While lions have few natural enemies, they face serious threats from humans. These include habitat
                    loss,
                    human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Lions are currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, with
                    populations
                    declining in many parts of their range.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about lions include that they are the only truly social big cats, their roar is the
                    loudest among
                    big cats, and they can run at speeds of up to 80 km/h in short bursts. Despite their fearsome
                    reputation, lions
                    succeed in only about one out of every four hunts on average.</p>

                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the Lions at just past the Elephant pen.</p>
