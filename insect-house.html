                <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                <p>Step into a miniature world full of fascinating creatures at the <strong>Insect House</strong>! This
                    unique exhibit
                    is home to a wide variety of insects from around the globe, including colorful butterflies,
                    leaf-mimicking katydids,
                    giant beetles, stick insects, ants, and more. It’s a must-visit for curious minds and nature lovers
                    of all ages.</p>

                <p>The Insect House is both educational and interactive, offering up-close views of insects in
                    naturalistic
                    environments. Watch leafcutter ants at work, observe the delicate transformation of a caterpillar
                    into a butterfly,
                    or marvel at the intricate camouflage of a praying mantis. Each enclosure is designed to mimic the
                    insect’s natural
                    habitat, giving visitors a better understanding of their role in ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Informative displays and interactive touchscreens provide fascinating facts about each species, from
                    how insects
                    communicate to the vital role they play in pollination, decomposition, and the food chain. Live
                    demonstrations and
                    feeding times are scheduled throughout the day for an even closer look.</p>

                <p>The Insect House is fully indoors and climate-controlled, making it a great place to explore rain or
                    shine. It’s the
                    perfect stop for families, students, or anyone with a sense of wonder about the small but mighty
                    world of insects.
                </p>

                <p>Open daily from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Don’t forget to visit the butterfly garden at the exit for a
                    magical experience
