                <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                <p>Step into the playful world of primates on <strong>Monkey Trail</strong>, an exciting, winding path
                    that takes you
                    through a vibrant habitat filled with curious, energetic monkeys. Designed to feel like a walk
                    through the jungle,
                    this interactive experience lets you observe different monkey species up close as they swing, climb,
                    and chatter
                    through the treetops.</p>

                <p>Monkey Trail is home to a variety of monkey species including capuchins, squirrel monkeys, and howler
                    monkeys.
                    Elevated walkways and glass-viewing domes give you unique perspectives and incredible photo
                    opportunities.</p>

                <p>Educational signs along the trail offer fun facts about monkey behavior, social structures, and
                    conservation efforts.
                    Kids can also enjoy interactive learning stations and jungle-themed play zones scattered throughout
                    the trail.</p>

                <p>Whether you're watching a monkey solve a puzzle, groom its friend, or leap from branch to branch,
                    there's always
                    something happening on Monkey Trail. Itâ€™s a must-visit for families, animal lovers, and anyone
                    looking to experience
                    the wild side of the zoo.</p>

                <p>Open during all zoo hours. Please remember to stay on the path, keep noise levels down, and never
                    feed the animals.
                </p>
