                <h3>GEMSBOK (ORYX GAZELLA)</h3>

                <p>The Gemsbok (pronounced "hems-bok") is a large antelope species native to the arid regions of
                    Southern Africa,
                    especially Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. It is the best-known species of the Oryx
                    genus and is well
                    adapted to desert environments.</p>

                <p>Gemsbok are large and striking in appearance. They stand around 1.1 to 1.2 meters at the shoulder and
                    can weigh
                    between 180 to 240 kilograms. Their bodies are light greyish-tan with distinct black and white
                    facial markings,
                    black legs, and a black stripe along each side. Both males and females have long, straight or
                    slightly curved horns
                    that can grow up to 85 centimeters or more, which they use for defense and dominance.</p>

                <p>This species thrives in desert and semi-desert environments like the Kalahari Desert. They are
                    incredibly
                    well-adapted to hot, dry climates and sparse vegetation. Gemsbok can survive without direct water
                    sources for long
                    periods by extracting moisture from the plants they eat.</p>

                <p>Gemsbok are herbivores and mainly feed on grasses, roots, bulbs, and wild fruits. They are known to
                    dig for
                    moisture-rich tubers and roots, especially during droughts, to supplement their water intake.</p>

                <p>Socially, Gemsbok typically live in herds of 10 to 40 individuals, although solitary adults and
                    bachelor herds are
                    also common. Males may become territorial and defend small areas against rivals. They are most
                    active during the
                    cooler parts of the day—early mornings and late afternoons—and conserve energy by resting during
                    peak heat.</p>

                <p>The gestation period of a Gemsbok is around 9 months, after which a single calf is usually born. The
                    calf remains
                    hidden for a few weeks to avoid predators before joining the herd. Calves grow quickly and become
                    relatively
                    independent within a short time.</p>

                <p>Predators of the Gemsbok include lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs, although adults
                    can be formidable
                    opponents. Gemsbok have been known to use their horns to defend themselves successfully, even
                    against lions.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about the Gemsbok include that it is the national animal of Namibia. They can
                    regulate their body
                    temperature to withstand extreme desert heat and have been observed impaling predators when
                    threatened. They are
                    often seen standing still for long periods to conserve energy in the harsh desert environment.</p>

                </strong>
                <p>You will find the Gemsbok at pen E26, right next to the coffee shop.</p>
