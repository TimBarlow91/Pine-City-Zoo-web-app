                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The Koala is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia, most commonly found in the eucalyptus
                    forests of
                    Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Despite often being called a "koala
                    bear," it is not a
                    bear at all, but a marsupial, meaning it carries and nurses its young in a pouch.</p>

                <p>Koalas have a stout, tailless body with thick, grey fur, a large nose, and fluffy ears. They
                    typically weigh between
                    4 to 15 kilograms, with males being larger than females. Koalas have strong limbs and sharp claws to
                    help them climb
                    trees and grip branches securely.</p>

                <p>Koalas are herbivores and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. They are very selective,
                    eating only certain
                    species of eucalyptus, and even then, they pick the youngest, most nutrient-rich leaves. Eucalyptus
                    leaves are low
                    in nutrition and high in toxins, so koalas have a slow metabolism and sleep for up to 18–22 hours a
                    day to conserve
                    energy.</p>

                <p>Koalas are mostly solitary animals, each occupying a home range that may overlap with others. They
                    communicate using
                    a range of vocalizations, especially during mating season. Males produce a deep bellowing call to
                    attract females
                    and warn other males.</p>

                <p>Breeding typically occurs between September and March. After a gestation period of about 35 days, a
                    single joey is
                    born and crawls into the mother’s pouch. The joey remains in the pouch for about six months, then
                    rides on the
                    mother's back for several more months while continuing to nurse and learn to eat leaves.</p>

                <p>Koalas are mostly active at night (nocturnal) and are expert climbers. They are not territorial but
                    do maintain home
                    ranges with favored trees. Koalas spend most of their lives in the trees and rarely come down to the
                    ground.</p>

                <p>Threats to koalas include habitat destruction due to urban development, bushfires, climate change,
                    disease
                    (especially chlamydia), and dog attacks. Their populations have declined significantly in recent
                    years, and in some
                    parts of Australia, they are listed as endangered.</p>

                <p>Interesting facts about koalas include their highly specialized digestive system, which can detoxify
                    poisonous
                    eucalyptus compounds, and their fingerprints, which are remarkably similar to human fingerprints.
                    Koalas also have a
                    strong sense of smell, which they use to identify suitable eucalyptus leaves.</p>

                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the Koalas at pen E30, right next to the Giraffes.</p>
